## How your two buttons should work (important)

### 🔹 Start a project → structured modal

This is your **serious** CTA.

**Fields (keep it tight):**

1. Name
2. Email
3. What are you building? (textarea)
4. Timeline (dropdown)
5. Budget range (dropdown)

### 🔹 Send me a message → lightweight modal

This is your **casual** CTA.

**Fields:**

1. Name
2. Email
3. Message

No budgets. No timelines.

## UX details that make it feel premium

### 1. Different modal personalities

Even if they reuse components, they should *feel different*.

**Start a project modal**

* Title: “Start a project”
* Subtitle: “Tell me a bit about what you’re building.”

**Message modal**

* Title: “Send me a message”
* Subtitle: “Have a question or idea? Let’s talk.”

---

### 2. Background treatment

When modal opens:

* Blur + darken background slightly
* Lock scroll
* Subtle scale-down of page (optional)

This reinforces focus.

---

### 3. Close behavior

* Click outside → closes
* Escape key → closes
* Visible ✕ button

No friction.

---

## Visual style suggestions (match your site)

* Same card style as pricing
* Rounded corners (same radius)
* Border: white/10
* Backdrop blur
* Slight top glow (you already do this well)

This makes the modal feel **native**, not bolted on.

---

## Implementation approach (no heavy JS)

You can do this with:

* Vanilla JS + Tailwind
* Or Alpine.js (perfect for this)
* Or even CSS + checkbox hack (but JS is cleaner)

Submission options:

* **Netlify Forms** (since you’re deploying there)
* Formspree
* Email backend later
